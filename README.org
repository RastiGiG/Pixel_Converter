#+TITLE: Pixel Converter

* Short Description

This program can convert image data from a 16-bit RGB variant (RGB565) to a 24-bit RGB (RGB888) variant or to 8-bit Grayscale and vice versa.
It also supports some Netpbm formats like PBM, PGM, PPM.

The code is not optimized, nor is it meant to be perfect. It is mainly used as learning opportunity and for testing.

Use it at your own risk.

:CAUTION:
It currently does NOT support images with alpha channels.
